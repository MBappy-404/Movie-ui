Live Demo: [https://cineverse-liart.vercel.app/](https://cineverse-liart.vercel.app/)

## What is this project?

CineVerse is a movie streaming web application for viewers and administrators. Users can discover, watch, review, and add movies to a personal watchlist for later viewing. Admins have a dashboard to manage content, users, and more. The platform is built with modern web technologies and offers a seamless, dark-mode-first experience.

### Key Capabilities
- **User Management:** Admins can view and manage users, ban/unban users, and view user activity stats.
- **Movie Management:** Add, update, and delete movies with rich details (title, description, genre, cast, release date, trailer, video, poster). Movies can be set as Published or Draft.
- **Category & Genre Management:** Create and assign categories/genres (e.g., Action, Drama, Comedy) for efficient movie organization.
- **Watchlist:** Users can add movies to a personal watchlist for later viewing.
- **Comments & Reviews Moderation:** View and moderate user reviews, enable/disable comments, delete inappropriate reviews, or pin top reviews.
- **Newsletter:** Send system-wide updates, promo alerts, or movie recommendations via email or in-app push notifications.
- **Purchase & Payment:** Users can buy or rent movies, and admins can view purchase history and payment analytics.
- **Dark Mode:** The dashboard and user interface are optimized for dark mode for better accessibility and user experience.

### Not Yet Implemented
- Assigning user roles (admin, moderator, viewer)
- Filtering users
- Watch history & analytics (track what each user has watched, generate analytics for most-watched movies, retention rates, etc.)
- Platform management (manage streaming platforms and assign movies to different platforms)

### Tech Stack
- Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, Redux Toolkit, and more

CineVerse is ideal for anyone looking to launch a modern movie streaming service with a beautiful user experience. Some advanced admin features are planned for future releases.
